OAuth2 CKAN extension
=====================

*Forked to provide support for CKAN 2.9*

The OAuth2 extension allows site visitors to login through an OAuth2 server.

**Note**: This extension was originally tested in CKAN 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8. The changes made in this repo attempts to provide support for CKAN 2.9 and Python 3. These changes work well enough for me and are not rigorously tested.
